## Welcome to a repo that tries to serve as guideline to identify areas of knowledge for the different levels of frontend developers, from Junior to Staff

With these guidelines in mind, you can design a good interview questionnaire, and even test


### I can see no algorithms!

Frontend developers may not be knowledeable in algorithms. A lot of them may not even have a computer sciences background. 
That does not mean that they do not acquired extensive and in-depth technical knowledge thru the years, but, it is highly unlikely Big-O Notation or algorithms such will
help them solve real life UX and UI problems.

### But we like white board during our interview process!!!

If you're so inclined to have a frontend developer entertain you at the white board, pose them a real life problem like, for example

* give them a real life specification and ask them how they would materialize that 
* consider they should use pseudo code to represent their ideas (real life developers, we google, and we google a lot. So putting a person under stress and under
non-realistic conditions, to solve a problem with code, may simply prevent you from hiring a great frontend developer.

I may post technical test ideas, too. And everyone is welcome to collaborate with this repo.

Have a great day!
