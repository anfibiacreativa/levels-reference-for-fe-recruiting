## Welcome to a repo that tries to serve as guideline to identify areas of knowledge for the different levels of frontend developers, from Junior to Staff

With these guidelines in mind, you can design a good interview questionnaire, and even a  take home test or a whiteboard test.


### I can see no algorithms!

Frontend developers may not be knowledeable in algorithms. A lot of them may not even have a computer sciences background. 
That does not mean that they did not acquire extensive practical and in-depth technical knowledge over the years, but, it is highly unlikely Big-O Notation or algorithms such will
help them solve real life UX and UI problems.

### But we like the whiteboard during our interview process!!!

If you're so inclined to have a frontend developer entertain you at the whiteboard, pose them a real life problem like, for example

* give them a real life specification and ask them how they would materialize that 
* consider they should use pseudo code to represent their ideas. It is not realistic to have somebody actually code working code on a whiteboard (real life developers, we google, and we google a lot). So putting a person under that kind of stress and 
non-realistic conditions to solve a problem with code, may simply prevent you from hiring a great frontend developer by missing the point of what really matters: How they think and how they solve problems that they WILL have.

I may post technical test ideas, too, later on. And everyone is welcome to collaborate with this repo.

Have a great day!
